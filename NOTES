- formatError converts exceptions to strings. This is not good, as it breaks
  traceback formatting, which expects exceptions to be exceptions.

  How else can plugins attach extra detail to exception output?
 
  Maybe move the format call to exc_info_to_string?

  Maybe turn of chaining in format_exception -- but does that hide potentially
  useful information?
